➡️ This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API built using Node.js and Express.js, with PostgreSQL as the database, 
all running in a Docker container environment. 
It provides a backend API for user management functionality, enabling operations such as creating a new user, 
retrieving user details, updating user information, and deleting users from the system.

🧑‍💻The core technologies include:

➡️Node.js - A JavaScript runtime used to build scalable network applications.

➡️Express.js - A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

➡️PostgreSQL - A powerful, open-source relational database for storing user data.

➡️Docker - A platform for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.


🔗Features:
User Creation: Allows the creation of new users with essential details such as name, email, and password.
User Retrieval: Fetches user details by their unique ID or retrieves a list of all users.
User Update: Allows modifications to the user data, such as updating profile information.
User Deletion: Enables the removal of users from the system.
Why use Docker?
Containerization: Ensures that the API and PostgreSQL database run smoothly in isolated containers, making it easy to set up and scale.
Consistency: Docker ensures the same environment is used across development, testing, and production.
